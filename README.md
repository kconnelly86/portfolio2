# Responsive-Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio, navigating around is simple enough just click on a page in the nav bar to take you to "About or Portfolio", or in the about me paragraph you may click the Portfolio link that is underlined. Once you've arrived at the portfolio just click on the image to navigate you off the site and to the deployed application. The Fire App is able to locate the closest fire to the zip code you enter, and the Translator will do as expected, just add what you want to translate, choose a language and hit translate.
Feel free to take a look at the links to git hub and linkedIn as well as send me an email with suggestions for the site or just to say hello.
